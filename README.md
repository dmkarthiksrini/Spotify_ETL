# Spotify_ETL

## Data Engineering 

Our Main idea is to create a Data Pipeline (Data Feed)

ETL Process - Extract Transform & Load

Download Data From Spotify and saves the Data in DB and how to schedule the program to run daily


### Extract :

Data Extraction from different sources, popular ones are API & FTP

* API is the one we will be looking into in this.
* Data will be available in the following formats CSV, json objects, XML file and so on from the API. It might also be in either Compressed (ZIP) or Uncompressed

_Free API are available_.


Data from the Spotify will be in JSON format, it resembles to python dictionaries
